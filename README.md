# Overview of Neural Network Charity Analysis

Bek is beginning her dive into neural networks! She is finally prepared to put her skills to work to assist in the foundation of how to predict where to make investments. With our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we utilized the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
